      I am bright eyed 28 year old lover of life. I am a front-end developer by
      day and a sports fanatic by night. The teams the hold my undying loyalty
      are the Oakland Raiders, well Las Vegas Raiders now, but its always going
      to be Oakland for me. The Golden State Warriors, the Chicago Bulls (Jordan
      era) and the Oakland A's. As you can tell I am very Bay Area biased. I now
      call Phoenix,AZ home and plan on staying here for as long as I can. In
      this blog you will read about a wide variety of things (mainly sports). I
      will share post about projects I am working on, the new world of
      parenthood, and not to mention sports...wait, did I mention that already?
